Final project Android mobile app + Website for BSc with Thesis attached

This project was originally developed on student version of github ran by university, so this is a fork of it. There are a lot of comments to explain every detail of the program, and the a PDF with the actual thesis itself which the application was based on. It was a 3 month development cycle including the thesis at a busy time in my final year of studies, I chose this project as my mom works as a Nurse in NHS and I saw first hand the experience of our health facility being short staffed, so I really wanted to make an impact with this project.
